These were removed from the end of prepOptions as they had no effect

  // Set defaults based on hide
  // options[hideJSON] = !options[hide] ? false : options[hideJSON]
  // options[hideJSON] = !options[hide] ? false : options[hideJSON]
  // options[hideObject] = !options[hide] ? false : options[hideObject]

maybe just bad tests
